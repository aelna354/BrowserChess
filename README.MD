# Browser Chess by aelna354

A port of my [Python Tkinter chess game](https://github.com/aelna354/PyChess) that works in the browser. Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Read the readme for that game, all the same rules.

Thanks to GitHub Pages, you can now play this [for free online!](https://aelna354.github.io/)

To-Do List:
* Make the mouse turn into a pointer when a movable piece or possible destination is hired over.
* Make it so that when a piece is hovered over, it will show all possible destinations.
* Implement castling and en passant.
